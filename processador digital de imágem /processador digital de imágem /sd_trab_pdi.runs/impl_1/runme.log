It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
WARNING: [DRC REQP-1839] RAMB36 async control check: The RAMB36E1 design_1_i/rom_0/U0/dout_reg_0_1 has an input control pin design_1_i/rom_0/U0/dout_reg_0_1/ADDRARDADDR[14] (net: design_1_i/rom_0/U0/address[14]) which is driven by a register (design_1_i/pdi_0/U0/controller/pixel_addr_reg[14]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.

This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
